This package contains the source of the Aelfred XML parser from
Microstar. Aelfred is a light-weight, non-validating XML parser.
These files are used by the hhreco.recognition package, and are
included in the HHreco source release in order to make it easier to
use and understand the XML parsers. These files are unmodified, with
the exception of changing the name of the package from
com.microstar.xml to hhreco.util.aelfred, and adding a package.html.
